####### SOUND-CARD CONFIGURATION #######
#
# PLEASE NOTE: It was very hard for me to migrate this
# program from the OSS API to the ALSA API, mainly because
# of the very sparse documentation and lack of a simple
# tutorial on Mixer programming. There may difficulties
# making this program run on platforms other than mine,
# if the sound card features are significantly different.
#
# Sound card hardware name: Default is hw:0 (first card).
# Other names can be hw:1 for the second sound card etc.
# There is a large number of possibilities for this entry
# which I can only just understand, but if this simple name
# string does not work, I am afraid you will need to have a
# look at the on-line ALSA documentation.
hw:0
#
# PCM Device Name
hw:0,0
#
# The sampling rate of the sound card's DSP. This should as 
# far as possible be the native speed of the DSP to avoid
# resampling, as it seems resampling distorts the signal.
# The default is 48000 but for older cards it may be 44100
48000
#
# The "channel" to be used for sound capture. ALSA uses the
# notion of a channel for the description of what input is
# being used for capture. With todays sound cards that have
# surround sound etc there can be many inputs to choose from
# to connect the audio o/p from a receiver. These are the
# channel descriptions I know of (alsa-lib 1.0.20) that can be
# used with xdemorse.
# FRONT_LEFT
# FRONT_RIGHT
# REAR_LEFT
# REAR_RIGHT
# SIDE_LEFT
# SIDE_RIGHT
# MONO
# The default is FRONT_LEFT (that works for me)
FRONT_LEFT
#
# Sound capture source: Default is Capture.
# but with some cards it may be Line.
Capture
#
# Sound capture volume control: Default is Capture.
# If volume setting is not possible or desired, replace with --
Capture
#
# Recording/Capture level: Useful range ~10-100%.
# The correct value must be found by testing, see xwefax.html.

# Use the Perseus SDR receiver for WEFAX reception. Specify PERSEUS
# to use the SDR Rx or RADIO to use one of the Radios below.
PERSEUS
#RADIO
#
# Correction for the Perseus' X/O frequency error (ppm). This is
# usually around 5ppm and must be found using another SDR application.
5.0
#
# Correction for the error in the sampling rate of the Perseus SDR.
# This value applies to my own unit but may be good enough for others.
82
#
# Enable CAT for Yaesu FT847 or FT857 or K3 transceiver.
# Setting is FT847 or FT857 or K3 or NONE, if you have
# some other transceiver or don't want CAT.
K3
#
# Serial port device for CAT: Please specify the serial port device
# you intend to use for CAT control of your tranceiver. PLEASE NOTE:
# CAT is available only for the YAESU FT-847, FT857 and Elecraft K3,
# which I own. If you are using some other tranceiver, there is no
# need to edit this entry BUT DO NOT ACTIVATE CAT BELOW.
/dev/k3

# Default Main Window Height in pixels.
750
#
# The frequency of the "white" signal. This is the frequency
# of the WEFAX AF signal that represents white in the image.
# Default value is 2300 Hz, to co-incide with amateur SSTV.
2300
#
# The frequency of the "black" signal. This is the frequency
# of the WEFAX AF signal that represents black in the image.
# Default value is 1500 Hz, to co-incide with amateur SSTV.
1500
#
# Maximum number of image lines to decode. xwefax will
# stop decoding a WEFAX image after this limit is exceeded.
# Default is 2500 lines.
2500
#
# Default Transmission Rate (RPM). This is specified
# in lines/min. Acceptable values are 60, 90, 100, 120,
# 180 and 240. Default is 120 lines/min.
# This is overwritten by data from the Stations list
# when a station is selected by the user.
120
#
# Default Resolution of the WEFAX image. This is usually
# specified in "lines" for HF WEFAX but in reality it is
# pixels/image line. Acceptable values are 600 and 1200.
# Default is 1200 pixels/line
# This is overwritten by data from the Stations list
# when a station is selected by the user.
1200
#
# Default IOC value. This is either 288 or 576 (default).
# This is overwritten by data from the Stations list
# when a station is selected by the user.
576
#
# Number of lines with phasing pulses, following the Start
# Tone. This is normally 60 but it can vary. Its better to
# specify a small number, else phasing will be spoiled.
# Values  should be 10, 20, 40 or 60. Default is 20.
# This is overwritten by data from the Stations list
# when a station is selected by the user.
20
#
# Image enhancement algorithm. At the moment these settings
# only are available:
# 0 = NONE - No image enhancement
# 1 = ENHANCE CONTRAST - Image contrast is normalized
# 2 = BILEVEL IMAGE - Brightness is thresholded to 0 or 255
0
